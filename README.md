# Video-Seizure-Classification
In this repository, two jupyter notebooks will be included; one (Exploratory Analysis On the Patients.ipynb) to analyze the patients database and one (Mean Baseline Aggregator and Classifiers.ipynb) to perform the model will be using along with the classifiers.
PLease keep in mind that the dataset isn't in its initial format, meaning that we had to edit model files (pth files) and not videos. Those pth files are extracted from a pretrained spatiotemporal CNN that the initial dataset was parsed through it.
